      <p align ="center">Kena worked hard to build a rewarding career with the autonomous software company Probe, but an internal transfer to the Middle East puts her ambitions to an unprecedented test as she and Probe's technology become involved in a conflict beyond their control. FORWARD DEPLOYED POLICY ENGINEER — EDGE OF THE SEARCH tells the story of how we build our careers and the trade-offs we accept in doing so. Set against the backdrop of a world shaped by autonomous technologies, it's a story of personal challenges that remain true in the future as much as today.</p>

      <p align = "center">FORWARD DEPLOYED POLICY ENGINEER — EDGE OF THE SEARCH follows Kena, a young technical writer documenting the software of Probe, a company that provides rebalancing engineering for autonomous cars to optimize their situational pathfinding. But Probe runs a side operation in the Middle East and Kena gets recruited into it. There, Kena encounters that the operation is run with little oversight from home and Probe's executive VP of Policy, Anna Dewand, exerts close control. As their technology becomes entwined in a local conflict, Kena has to go back into her past to ensure that her team can survive the emerging challenges. </p> 

      <p align = "center">The book follows Kena on the career path of a Forward Deployed Policy Engineer and documents the pressures we undergo to build meaningful careers. From scouting for jobs, preparing for interviews, coping with disappointments and making hard choices about our next steps. Building a career in 2029 is much like today. </p> 

      <p align = "center">EDGE OF THE SEARCH is the first book in the FORWARD DEPLOYED POLICY ENGINEER CYCLE and will be released in early 2020.</p>
