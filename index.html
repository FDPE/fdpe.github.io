      <p>Kena worked hard to build a rewarding career with the autonomous software company Probe, but an internal transfer to the Middle East puts her ambitions to an unprecedented test as she and Probe's technology become involved in a conflict beyond their control. FORWARD DEPLOYED POLICY ENGINEER — EDGE OF THE SEARCH tells the story of how we build our careers and the trade-offs we accept in doing so. Set against the backdrop of a world shaped by autonomous technologies, it's a story of personal challenges that remain true in the future as much as today.</p>
      
      <p>The next iteration of CAPS will start in late October 2019.</p>
